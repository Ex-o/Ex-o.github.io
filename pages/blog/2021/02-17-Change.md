## Can things actually change?

<img src="images/change_meme.png">

If you have studied physics at some point, hopefully, you noticed that it seems that the universe is designed in a way so that change happens only when necessary. Changing states, according to physics, is no easy feat and usually takes additional effort unlike trying to perserve a state why usually requires... nothing. We have so many examples for this: Lenz's law, the law of inertia (Newton's first law), conservation of energy and momentum, etc. Why does the universe hate change so much?

Let's put physics to the side for a bit and try to look at something else, our bodies maybe.
``
The mind unlearns with difficulty what it has long learned - Seneca.
``
But why is that? Perhaps, if we can understand by looking at what consititutes "having learned" something. Is it memorization? If it was, then it shouldn't be hard to forget it! We all forget things on a daily basis. Surely, memorizing something doesn't mean we learned it. Is it neurological? We know that when we learn something, the brain creates different pathways to make it easier to do it later. Along these pathways there are some "flags", some bigger than others, which mark different stages and could justify why different parts of an action vary in difficulty. An interesting idea would be to look at the process of learning something rather than the result of having learned it. The act of repeating something until it's become easy to do usually implies necessity. It's necessary for a musician to seamlessly play while reading notes. For the same reason, different stages of mastery are required thus, different stages of learning. Anyone who has played an instrument would know how frustrating it is to try and correct a mistake that's been practiced for years. A similar analogy would be people who type a certain way on the keyboard. It's extremely difficult and frustrating to adopt a new position for your hands that could possibly in the future help you type faster and with more accuracy. 

An important thing to note as well is that our brains are very good at maintaining efficiency. That comes with a downside when trying to prematurely optimize something you've alread optimized for so long. If we use the same example of musicians or keyboard typing, you'd see that whatever you'd be trying to "unlearn" to fix some mistake that's hindering a possible boost in performance would directly reduce your overall efficiency for probably a long time. If you change your hand positioning while typing, you're more likely to see that your performance is getting worse. What for? A possible improvement? Your brain doesn't really like that. We could expand on this later and discuss gratification in more details but for now let's go back to some physics!

Just like our brains like efficiency, atoms like stability. As a general rule of thumb, whenever a state is prefered, it's always going to be harder to change it. So for electrons to change their positions, you need to force them. But is that the case with everything? When we look at momentum, is there any real reason for why it wouldn't change? Why would an object care about whether it's moving or not? Yeah well, it doesn't. It's us who want to see this inclination. Why? It's easier to understand. It's easier to understand momentum when we know it doesn't change. So it's us who look for these inclinations to help ourselves understand things better. 

An interesting misconception that most people have that relates to this idea would be entropy. Most people assume the universe has to come to an end at some point because as "what goes up, must come down". That's just as wrong as it is to easily understand. There are a lot of things we would have to know about the universe before we can get comfortable with our definition of entropy, or at least what it entails. Maybe we will find out later that the universe is a closed system (we sort of already did but not really) and thus entropy can only increase as proven by Boltzmann.
