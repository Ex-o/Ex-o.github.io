<div style="text-align: justify">

Oh hey there! Welcome back I guess. It seems to me that my boring life is peaking your curiosity. Well, it‚Äôs better to not have any expectations and to be ready to drop this at any moment without regrets. Speaking of regrets, let me tell you about a few of mine.  The first thing that comes to mind is being a dick to whoever showed me some kindness but wasn‚Äôt up to my standards at the time. I am sure if you read the previous part of this sad story you should have noticed that I am or was pretty judgmental. This cost me a lot and the saddest part is that I only realized it after it was too late. I think at this point in my life I have lost everything other than good health, for now at least. Now you might ask why is that I think being judgmental contributed to what I‚Äôve become. And it‚Äôs really simple. I had a lot of chances to make connections with people and I wasted most of them. I picked very few people that I thought lived up to me. I was very arrogant. I hope after you read this you‚Äôll understand that it‚Äôs something you want to get as far as you can from.
