So for the past couple of days I have been alone thinking and I came up with a random idea while reading a book. Since I am documenting fragments of my days I decided to pick a paragraph or two, likely the most interesting ones, from what I read everyday. I have also thought about using quotes. Now whichever I pick for the day is going to be the theme around which I start writing. Also realize how I use way too many I's. I need to learn how to use it less.

clever persons, I think we should employ the method of search that we should use if we, with not very keen vision, 
were-bidden to read small letters from a distance, and then someone had observed that these same letters exist 
elsewhere larger and on a larger surface. We should have accounted it a godsend, I fancy, to be allowed to read those letters first, and then examine the smaller, if they are the same. - The Republic, Book II, Plato

I instantly thought about how I think my life sucks. But life is a lot to think about so I wanted to pick a smaller frame that I also think I don't like and start analyzing why I don't like it. Also this is very hard. I can't talk about my life without using 'I'. Anyway, looking at the people I dislike I failed to really come up with explicit reasons as to why I feel that way about them. One thing could be that they seem ignorant but that's subjective. I could be the ignorant one overcomplicating things that shouldn't be complicated and thinking people who figured this fact are ignorant. But how do we know? I am not a philosopher! And even if I were I would know that I can't know for sure that I am right. So if I can't know for sure if my disliking them is real or not why not be neutral. Why not judge people based on actions not based on their overall ideology. People who are optimistic in situations that are clearly not going well. Why should they annoy me? Is it because I can see that their optimism is in vain? If we were to measure how being optimistic affects them in the short term then we'd see that they will remain in a much better mindstate until their optimism fails them than those who were pessimistic from the go. So being optimistic only served them better. For sure it was an illusion. Their hopes were deemed to be dimished by the reality of their situation but so what? In the end, less time suffering was spent. Being a realist is not always beneficial it seems.
<br /><br />

How does this relate to my life in general? Well since I tend to be on the extreme end of being a pessimist then perhaps if I were to adopt a different way of thinking I'd spend less time thinking about all the wrong things that are happening in my life and just wait till the real bad things happen.

<p>Another thing I will be doing from now on is pick a song and a picture everyday. Itâ€™ll be called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Art of the Day</code>. The goal is to remember all the pieces I used to like and get familiar with more paintings because I like paintings and I like remembering what theyâ€™re called for some reaosn.</p>
