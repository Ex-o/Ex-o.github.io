Yesterday, a competition for programmers was held in my hometown. I was watching the livestream and all I could think of was how are all these people better than me. I donâ€™t understand it and I donâ€™t accept it. I keep telling myself maybe because they work hard and I donâ€™t but it doesnâ€™t convince me. I am just jealous. I know a lot of those people and many are sort of my friends. I still refuse the fact that I might not be as smart. Why? Because I am stupid. I do nothing at all to push myself and I expect to perform better than everyone that does. Why? Because I am entitled. Why? I donâ€™t know. Being aware doesnâ€™t make it less bad though. Itâ€™s worse when you know the reasons but still have doubts about why arenâ€™t you doing anything to change them. You start feeling that youâ€™re either useless or just whining. I got the whining part figured out. I am a whiner. 
<br /><br />
As I mentioned before, those who get close to me notice that I am a whiner very fast. For example, yesterday, Farah said I complain a lot. Of course she always knew that but I guess yesterday was the first time she called me out for it. How should someone that knows that heâ€™s a whiner react when people call him a whiner? To me at least, it should be fine. But itâ€™s not. You know youâ€™re a whiner but you donâ€™t like being called one. Again, I donâ€™t know why. However, thereâ€™s a bright side. Farah is busy and she doesnâ€™t talk to me as much as before. I am just saying sheâ€™s busy because thatâ€™s probably what I want to believe but she could be bored of talking to me. She already mentioned that I was lame quite a few times already but who knows. I started trying to get more sleep. Six hours from 1 AM to 7 AM every day. Every morning I wake up, get dressed and head to the gym. Itâ€™s a free gym membership that comes with my status as a student in this university so I thought I might as well use it right? I am trying to put some more work. Itâ€™s not good enough. I am still wasting time. I am writing this so you should get an idea. I listen to music a lot. I wanted to try quiting but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s worth it. I should study more but for some reason or actually I know the reason. I wasnâ€™t too happy that I came to this university as I think itâ€™s not good enough for me (again being arrogant) so I was like screw this and just stayed here doing random stuff. I could go back to Egypt and become a computer engineer but why am I here? Wasting another year maybe. Looks like itâ€™s become an addiction of mine, haha! 
<br /><br />
I am also trying to apply to a summer internship at google. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll pass obviously but why not try. Everyone says just go for stuff and wait. So I am trying this instead of already pre-assuming Iâ€™ll fail. Ah, reminds me of something that also happened yesterday. I got the grade for the mathematics midterm exam. I got a full score because I decided to just go for it. There was a question that would be graded by the main professor of the course and I wasnâ€™t sure if I could solve it. Only 15mins were left and I thought Iâ€™ll get 15/20 at best if I just leave now without solving that question. Then I decided to write the solution as it probably wonâ€™t hurt. I got a 7/7. Not something to be proud of but it was nice. Well I think thatâ€™s about it for what happened yesterday. See you later maybe.

## Not yet!

Hi there! The day isnâ€™t done yet but I wanted to tell you more about it. Today was a good day, I am in a somewhat good mood. I havenâ€™t talked to anyone I want sadly but I was able to wake up today at 7 AM again despite sleeping at 2AM. I went to the gym again. My muscles are sore but I donâ€™t care. I still managed to waste many hours doing random stuff but I also donâ€™t care. It should work out soon as long as I keep this routine thing going. I am not on a 4-day streak. I still feel empty that Farah isnâ€™t here but I am managing. Lately I stopped spamming her every other minute. In fact, I donâ€™t think I enjoy being ignored or just talking to myself in case sheâ€™s busy. I really admire that sheâ€™s focused despite her parents constantly being harsh. I actually love her which is funny. Anyway, I still get occasional spikes of stress when I think about the future and which decisions I made for myself that I might not be able to correct later. Theyâ€™re decreasing though. I donâ€™t think I am doing anything special these days but I am adapting to whatever this is. A new life methodology that doesnâ€™t depend on others. Others fail you and you have nobody to blame. But if you fail yourself at least you have yourself to blame. So itâ€™s convenient for a whiner like me. I always need something to blame. I am still writing this resume to apply to google. I havenâ€™t talked to my family properly in about 2 weeks. Whenever they call they ask questions that stress me out and I panic. Anyway, thatâ€™s all for today. I hope tomorrow will be a good day.
